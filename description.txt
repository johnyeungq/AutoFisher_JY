**AutoFisher JY** is a quality-of-life mod for Terraria that automates the fishing process, making it easier to farm fish, crates, and other fishing treasures!

## Features
- **Automatic Casting:** The mod will automatically cast your fishing rod when you hold it in the first inventory slot (slot 0) and have it selected.
- **Automatic Reeling:** When a fish bites, the mod will automatically reel in your catch.
- **Visual Feedback:** On each cast and reel-in, you'll see in-game messages and effects to let you know the mod is working.
- **Simple to Use:** Just equip your fishing pole in slot 0, select it, and enjoy effortless fishing!

## How to Use
1. Place your fishing pole in the first inventory slot (slot 0).
2. Select the fishing pole (make sure it's the active item).
3. Stand near water and let the AutoFisher do the work!
4. The mod will automatically cast, wait for bites, and reel in your catches.

## Notes
- The mod only works when your fishing rod is in the first inventory slot and is the selected item.
